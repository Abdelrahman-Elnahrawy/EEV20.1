## 📌 Project Overview

**EEV20.1** is an **Emergency Electronic Ventilator** developed as an open-source engineering project.  
The goal is to demonstrate a complete ventilator system including **mechanical design**, **electronics**, and **embedded control firmware**.

This repository focuses on:
- System architecture
- Mechanical enclosure & mechanism
- Embedded firmware structure
- Documentation & design files

> ⚠️ This project is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The ventilator system consists of:

- Mechanical compression system
- Motor-driven actuation
- Embedded controller (ATmega128A)
- Sensors for monitoring
- User interface & safety logic

The **3D model** provides a clear visualization of how these subsystems integrate.
